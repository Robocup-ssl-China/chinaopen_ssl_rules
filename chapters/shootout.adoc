== Shoot-Out
.Definition
Both teams alternately attempt to score a goal until each team has performed 5 attempts. If both teams have the same score after those 5 attempts, each team takes another attempt in the same order as before until the score of the two teams is different.

Only one attacking robot and one keeper is allowed per team. During a shoot-out attempt, the attacking robot and the opponent keeper are the only ones allowed to move and <<Ball Manipulation, manipulate the ball>>. Other robots are not allowed to interfere.

The procedure of a shoot-out attempt is as follows:

. The ball is placed by the human referee on the <<Additional Lines, mid-line>> (not halfway line), 8 meters (division A) or 6 meters (division B) away from the opponent goal.
. When the <<Penalty Kick, penalty>> command is issued, the defending keeper has to move to the goal line and keep touching it.
. When the <<Normal Start, normal start>> command is issued, the attacker is allowed to <<Ball Manipulation, manipulate the ball>>. The ball has to only move towards the opponent goal, as measured by its x coordinate in the coordinate system of <<Vision, SSL-Vision>>.
. When the ball is <<Ball In And Out Of Play, in play>>, the defending keeper may move freely again, analogous to a <<Penalty Kick, penalty kick>>.

A goal is awarded if:

* the ball touches the inner surface of a goal wall or the ground of the goal of the defending team in less than 10 seconds, starting from when the <<Normal Start, normal start>> command is issued
* the defending team violates any rule

A goal is not awarded if:

* the ball crosses any <<Field Lines, field lines>> outside the goal
* the defending keeper touches the ball such that the ball speed vector changes direction by at least 90 degrees in 2D space
* the attacking team violates any rule

NOTE: The restrictions defined for <<Scoring Goals, scoring goals>> do not apply here. This explicitly includes the ball height limit of 0.15 meters. Other rules like the <<Excessive Dribbling, excessive dribbling>> limitation for example do.

Robots may be <<Robot Substitution, substituted>> between shoot-out attempts. The new robot may be put in right away.

NOTE: Note that <<Timeouts, timeouts>> are not allowed during shoot-out.

.Usage
Shoot-Out is used to determine the winner of an elimination match if both teams scored the same amount of goals in previous <<Game Stages, game stages>>.
